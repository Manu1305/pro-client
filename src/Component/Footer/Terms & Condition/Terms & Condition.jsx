              9.1 HiTec Mart is merely a facilitator and is not and cannot be a
              party to or control in any manner any advertisement, exhibition,
              making available, offer to sell or transactions of sale or
              purchase on the Platform. 9.2 When a product is listed for sale on
              the Platform by a Seller, products sold to Buyer by the Seller
              will be governed by the bipartite contractual arrangement entered
              into directly between the Buyer and the Seller. Buyer agrees that
              HiTec Mart cannot and does not confirm each Seller’s purported
              identity. HiTec Mart encourages Buyers to exercise discretion and
              caution while dealing with various Sellers. 9.3 User further
              acknowledges and undertakes that it shall use the Platform or
              Services only for its lawful business purposes. Buyer agrees to
              purchase the products from the Seller for further resale or
              commercial purpose and shall not use the products purchased for
              your personal use or consumption. 9.4 For any Services, HiTec Mart
              does not act as a representative for either the Seller or the
              Buyer in specific transactions. HiTec Mart also does not exercise
              control and is not accountable for the quality, safety,
              suitability, legality, or availability of the products or services
              offered for sale on the Platform. Additionally, HiTec Mart is not
              responsible for the Seller’s ability to complete a sale or the
              Buyer&#39;s ability to complete a purchase. HiTec Mart does not
              explicitly or implicitly endorse or support the sale or purchase
              of any products on the Platform. At no point does HiTec Mart
              acquire any right, title, or interest in the products sold through

              or liabilities with respect to any transactions conducted on the
              Platform. 9.5 HiTec Mart shall neither be liable nor responsible
              for any actions or inactions of the User nor any breach of
              conditions, representations or warranties of the products and
              hereby expressly disclaims any and all responsibility and
              liability in that regard. HiTec Mart shall not mediate or resolve
              any dispute or disagreement between Buyer and the Seller of the
              products or any third party that is rendering services to you. 9.6
              In the event that any User has a dispute with any party to a
              transaction such User agrees to release and indemnify HiTec Mart
              (and our agents, affiliates, directors, officers and employees)
              from all claims, demands, actions, proceedings, costs, expenses
              and damages (including without limitation any actual, special,
              incidental or consequential damages) arising out of or in
              connection with such transaction. This clause shall also apply to
              any services opted for by the User by accessing any link from
              HiTec Mart site to avail of any independent services related to
              the transaction of buy-sell conducted on the Platform from any
              third party. 9.7 We do not provide any warranties or
              representations regarding the information, content, products
              listed on the Platform, or the delivery of these products. The
              User acknowledges that we act solely as an intermediary connecting
              Buyers and Sellers. The User further agrees, acknowledges, and
              confirms that we bear no responsibility for the products purchased
              by the Buyer from the Seller. It is explicitly agreed that under
              no circumstances will we be held responsible or liable for
              products purchased by the Buyer from the Seller, or for any issues
              or disputes related to such purchases. In the aforementioned
              situations, the User agrees, acknowledges, and confirms that the
              Buyer&#39;s only recourse will be with the Seller, and we will not
              be involved as a party in any such issues or disputes between the
              Seller and the Buyer. 9.8 The User(s) are entirely responsible for
              obtaining any necessary licenses and permissions from third
              parties, if required by applicable law, to possess the right and
              authority (if mandated by applicable laws) for reselling, trading,
              redistributing, exporting, or offering products or services. It is
              essential that these actions comply with all relevant laws and
              regulations.

              or unenforceable, such provision shall be deleted and the

              HiTec Mart does not enforce a particular right or does not take
              action regarding a breach by the User under the Terms, it does not
              imply a waiver of that right, nor does it constitute a waiver of
              HiTec Mart’s ability to take action in response to subsequent or
              similar breaches in the future. 14.5 HiTec Mart retains the right
