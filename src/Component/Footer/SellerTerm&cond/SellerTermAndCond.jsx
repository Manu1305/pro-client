            <p className={idea.wholesaleP}>
              {" "}
              12.1 Confidential Information disclosed by one Party (“Disclosing
              Party”) to the other Party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally, in
              writing, or in any other form, that is designated as confidential
              or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given
              the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure.
              The Receiving Party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
              Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and to use it solely
              for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this
              Agreement. 12.2 The Receiving Party shall limit access to the
              Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to its employees,
              contractors, or agents who have a legitimate need to access such
              information and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at
              least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement. 12.3
              The Receiving Party shall take all reasonable measures to protect
              the confidentiality and integrity of the Disclosing Party’s
              Confidential Information and shall exercise the same degree of
              care as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a
              similar nature, but not less than a reasonable degree of care.
              12.4 Exceptions to Confidentiality: The obligations of
              confidentiality set forth in this Agreement shall not apply to any
              information that: (i) was already known to the Receiving Party
              prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (ii) is or
              becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving
              Party; (iii) is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a
              third party without a duty of confidentiality; (iv) is
              independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference
              to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (v) is
              required to be disclosed by the Receiving Party pursuant to a
              valid court order or governmental request, provided that the
              Receiving Party provides the Disclosing Party with prompt notice
              of such requirement and cooperates with the Disclosing Party’s
              efforts to seek a protective order or otherwise limit or prevent
              such disclosure. 12.5 The obligations of confidentiality set forth
              in this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of
              this Agreement and shall continue for a period of two (2) years
              from the date of termination or expiration. 12.6 The Receiving
              Party acknowledges that a breach of this Confidentiality Clause
              may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, for which
              monetary damages may be inadequate. Therefore, the Disclosing
              Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including
              injunctive relief, in addition to any other remedies available at
              law or in equity.

              the Force Majeure Event and to resume the performance of their
              obligations under this Agreement as soon as reasonably
              practicable. 14.3 If the Force Majeure Event continues for a
              period of sixty (60) days or more, either Party shall have the
              right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to

              for any further performance or non-performance of its obligations
              under this Agreement. 14.4 If a Force Majeure Event occurs,
              neither Party shall be entitled to any compensation, damages, or
              penalties for the non-performance or delay in performance of its
